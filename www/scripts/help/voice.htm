<br>
Voice files are added to a project through uploading, or a "Copy to Project" process.  Voice files can be recorded using the dial-in recording features.  Recorded messages are digitally converted and then stored on the Voice server in the Customer Files section.<br>
<br>
In this form, the Customer files are viewed on the right side of the form.  Files currently assigned to the project are viewed on the left.  Voice prompt files are copied from the Customer files to the project by first highlighting the voice file on the right, and then clicking on the "Copy to Project" button.<br>
<br>
Files can also be copied from the project to the Customers folder on the Dialin Voice Server using the "Copy to Customer".<br>
