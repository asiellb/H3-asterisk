Allows the Project Administrator to perform a "Testcall" to verify the voice prompts and hear the exact same message(s) played for each answered call.<br>
<br>
When submitted, the telephone number entered will be dialed with the call progress displayed below.  When the phone is answered, both the "live.vox" and "machine.vox" files will played for verification.  Once the messages have been verified and approved the project can be manually activated.
