CURRENT:

BACK-BURNER:
* surveys with P1 option
* when CO_Rate == 0.00 projects should not be allowed to leave machine messages
* ColdCaller: (from Carl) if the agent gets a machine, press a key and it leaves a pre-recorded message (happens after bad answer detect)
* improve call rating accuracy: using latest rate-decks for npanxx-->lata ocn map, update sbn2.phones
* uppgrade to Lucid 10.04 http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/lucid/
* write a JSON and perl based session class to replace PHP stuff (GLM::Session)
* automatic redialing for Mark msl - once a file is "finished" redialing kicks in
* cold calling fanciness
	- all prospect calls have disposition HU?
	- graphs
	- Agents must have MustLogin='Y' when on PJ_Type == C
	- emergency shutdown? 
	- what if prospect hang-up in the queue before getting to an agent. what is his cdr: HU

* Canadian DNC list on its own table
* phones table smartness: keep track of every connection
	- during scrubbing, if it there was a previous connection then it known connectable
	- during routing can pick a better carrier
* dialer change: when we get 2 bad originations, return number, and remove this carrier from the bestcarriers, if non left copy alternates to best, if still non left then call it BA
* dialer install on w015 (eth0 hardware error)
* Asterisk dialers - prevent interstate agent calls by having the agi server send the CID for the agent
* remove ln_priority\|ln_line\|ln_dti\|ln_voice
* rename PJ_Timeleft ---> PJ_RunInfo
* automatic lead management to block certain files/zones
* hottish backup in LA for w0 (mysql slave, projects dir rsync'ed etc) or maybe do some HA stuff

NICE TO HAVE:
* security: convert stored clear-text passwords to hashed (Digest::SHA using sha256)
* using OpenSIPS to balance load for coldcalling etc
* Apple Mac Excel produces CSV files with \0D line endings that don't get parsed
* add more substance to the help pages (www/help)
* UI for global system CID defaults?!? updates VoxSystems/TELEBIT/TELEBIT.GBL && Astdialer.pl && FastAgiServer
* 21:40 should rotate logs too
* customer DNC using area-codes
* new project features:
	- timezones for dialing selection
	- project dial-rates: connects-per-hour, optimum-transfers,
	- daily maxima: dials, connects, minutes
